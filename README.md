## Blitz Card Game

## Objective
Achieve the highest total value of cards of the same suit. The highest possible score is 31.
A 10, a face card (Jack, Queen, King), and an Ace of the same suit instantly win!

## How to Play
Each player is dealt 3 cards in their hand. At the start of the game, turn order is automatically randomized.

On your turn, you can do one of the following:
- Draw from the deck
- Take the top card from the discard pile
- Knock

If you knock, all other players get one more turn, and then the game ends. The game also automatically ends if there are no more cards to draw from in the deck.
The player with the highest suit total at the end of the game wins!

## Card Values
Number cards: Face value (e.g., 2 of Hearts = 2 points)

Face cards (Jack, Queen, King): 10 points each

Aces: 11 points

## Scoring
Your score is determined by the highest total value of cards from a single suit. All cards of the same suit in your hand are added together. 

For example, suppose a player had this hand:
- 7 of Clubs
- King of Diamonds
- 8 of Clubs

The player's score would be 15 because the Clubs suit contributes the most to their hand.

## Automatic Win Condition
The game will immediately end when a player has a 10, a face card, and an Ace of the same suit in their hand.
